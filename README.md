Gulp.js with NancyFx
====================

A simple ASP.NET solution to showcase a Node.js-based front-end development workflow.

## The idea

Some people would call this blasphemy, but ASP.NET/NancyFx applications can make use of a modern client-side development workflow.

## What do you need

- Visual Studio (tested on 2013);
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/);
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed globally: `npm i -g gulp`;
